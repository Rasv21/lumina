# Lumina
Lumina is a software that allows you to get an estimation of how many light fixtures you will need to put a given space based on inputs such as its dimensions and areas, as well as the luminous flux of the fixtures and the Illuminance Requirement for the activities that would be performed in that space.

This is a rough estimation based on the Lumen's Method.

This is the very first piece of software I have developed, and Python was the chosen programming language.
